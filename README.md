# CMDR-HFA
Cross Modality Disentangled Representation for Heterogeneous Face Analysis

We will realse the code in the future.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- pytorch1.1
- CUDA & GPU available device
## Experiments
### Video Demo

we supply the video of modality factor traversal results to show the continuous cross modality translation process clearly. In the video, the first three rows show input examples from training set and the fourth row shows input examples from testing set.

### Additonal results of modality factor traversal 

![](log/Exp_CUFSF_extra.jpg)

Additonal results of modality factor traversal on the CUFSF sketch database. Each row shows the face images generated by varying the latent modality factor of the same face image. The first fourth rows show results of input examples from training set and the last two rows show results of input examples from testing set.
